<p>The aim of the blog is to demystify the stock market and show how you can be profitable by taking simple actions and using easy-to-follow strategies.</p>

<p>The insights I will share in my articles will be mostly based on strategies that are back tested using python code and real stocks data mostly downloaded from Yahoo Finance. If you are a code fanatic like me, you can follow through the code links I will share in the articles so that you can test the reliability of the strategies, and reproduce the results. Of course you can contact me should you have any questions.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-author">About the author</h2>

<p>I am an Oxford University MBA graduate that loves the stock market. I wish to share with you my knowledge and insights FOR FREE.</p>

<p>Before my MBA, I acquired an MSc in Software Engineering from  Oxford Brookes University and a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Zambia. No wonder I love using python code, Big Data, Machine Learning, and statistics to synthesise and back-test strategies before sharing them on this blog.</p>

<p>I hope you will enjoy reading my blog and find it informative.</p>
