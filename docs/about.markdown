Of course you can contact me should you have any questions.

## About the author

I am an Oxford University MBA graduate that loves the stock market. I wish to share with you my knowledge and insights FOR FREE.

Before my MBA, I acquired my MSc in Software Engineering from  Oxford Brookes University and BSc in Computer Science from the University of Zambia. No wonder I love to use python code, Big Data, Machine Learning, and statistics to synthesise and back-test strategies before sharing them on this blog.
